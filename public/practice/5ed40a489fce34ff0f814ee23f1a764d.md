## Distributed Lock Manager

**Question:** Design a distributed lock manager for coordinating access to shared resources

**Hints:**
- Consider using a consensus algorithm for distributed coordination
- Think about how to handle lock timeouts and client failures
- Explore options for implementing different types of locks (e.g., read, write)
- Consider how to detect and prevent deadlocks
- Think about scaling the system to handle many locks and clients

> #### Key Considerations:
