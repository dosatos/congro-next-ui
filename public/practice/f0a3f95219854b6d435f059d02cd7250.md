## Distributed Cache

**Question:** Design a distributed caching system for a large-scale web application

**Hints:**
- Consider different consistency models (e.g., eventual consistency)
- Think about how to partition data across multiple nodes
- Explore options for replicating data for fault tolerance
- Consider how to handle node failures and data recovery
- Think about scaling the cache horizontally

> #### Key Considerations:
> - Cache consistency
> - Partitioning and replication
> - Fault tolerance and recovery
