## Time Series Database

**Question:** Design a time series database for storing and querying sensor data

**Hints:**
- Consider using a columnar storage format for efficient compression
- Think about how to handle high write throughput
- Explore options for indexing and querying time-based data
- Consider implementing automatic downsampling for older data
- Think about how to handle out-of-order data ingestion

> #### Key Considerations:
> - Data model and storage
> - Efficient querying
> - Data retention and downsampling
