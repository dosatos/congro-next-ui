## Distributed Database

**Question:** Design a distributed database system like Google Spanner

**Hints:**
- Consider implementing a sharding strategy for data partitioning
- Think about how to achieve global consistency across distributed nodes
- Explore options for implementing distributed transactions
- Consider using atomic clocks for precise time synchronization
- Think about how to handle node failures and network partitions

> #### Key Considerations:
> - Data partitioning and replication
> - Consistency and transaction management
> - Global clock synchronization
